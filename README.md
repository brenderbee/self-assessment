## Self-Assessment
1. _Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?_
  I would be more confident in a job search if I felt more prepared for the technical interview and non-technical. There is a tendency for me to get nervous when I stand in the front of the room. My memory isn't the best when asked to perform in this capacity. I would like to have more Javascript methods in my toolkit. 

2. _Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?_
  I'm a little unclear what a typical work day looks like and what the expectations are. Knowing what the expectations are would help me feel more confident. I would also like to learn D3.js since I feel like this would be a useful skill.
